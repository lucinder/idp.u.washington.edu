# UW Fake Student ID Login Webpage Mockup
MOCKUP - mock phishing webpage to steal student id logins for a cybersec assignnment. NOT A REAL PHISHING PAGE OR UW WEBPAGE.

This mockup uses the CSS and html of the actual login page as a base. I do not own the UW websites' code for that, and my changes here are minimal to demonstrate the ease of a polished webpage mockup for potential malicious purposes!

While this is for a fake-phishing assignment, this webpage does NOT steal your credentials. In a real phishing scenario, it absolutely would. However, this page is safe, and you are welcome to enter false credentials and play around with the page at your leisure.
